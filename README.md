# macro_puzzles
Collection of puzzles in macroeconomics or infamous failures of contemporaneous macro-models

The idea behind this repo is to collect puzzling evidence and open questions concering macroeconomic research. Likewise it aims to be a compilation of the contradictions between economic theory and the empirical evidence. Hopefully it will help us all (and motivated junior researchers) to focus on the importan questions and the big picture, and not to get lost in (technical) details. 

This list is tought to be constructive and **not** intendet to be a one-sided critique on macroeconomics/DSGE models/rational Expectations as a whole. Please try to be concise and neutral. Put details like literature or links in the Wiki, that is part of this repo.

A non-exhaustive List
------
* The Phillips Curve is flat (and potentially doesn't exist)
* Intertemporal substitution is a too simplistic view on the monetary transmission mechanism
* Survey evidence contradicts the rational expectations hypothesis
