# How to Contribute

Hello and glad you have input to the list!

I chose git to host this list because it makes collaboration easy while still granting some control over the list. It also reflects the spirit of open source projects, which (in economics) I strongly want to support.

Contributing is very simple, all you need is an account with github. Many economics working with code already have one, if not it is a thing of less than a minute. Once you logged in, go to the [macro_puzzles repository](https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles), select the file you want to edit (for example the [list itself](https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md)), and click the small edit button (the pen). Once you are done adding or editing, just click the green 'propose file change' button at the bottom.

## contributing to the list

For the [list itself](https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md), please keep it short and precise. Each *puzzle* entry should follow the following structure:
* **puzzle-name**: *short explanation of puzzle* (citation where puzzle is first mentioned as 'authors', 'year', 'journal')

## contributing to the detailed descriptions

Some puzzles link to a more detailed description. You are also free to add such if a puzzle does not have it, but you would like to get into detail. This is the place to give in-debth explanation of each puzzle in the list and discuss potential solutions from the literature. 

For each puzzle, please stick to a rough structure of:
1. Detailed description of the puzzle
2. Briefly reference were the puzzle was encountered (literatur)
3. Discuss resolutions from the literatur. Please do not discuss your opinion unless you published it somewhere as this is not meant to be a discussion forum.

Once you are done, be invited to add yourself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/contributors.md)!
